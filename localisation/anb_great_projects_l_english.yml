 the_necropolis:0 "The Neratic Necropolis"
 the_necropolis_desc:0 "------------\n Across the river Cotumer from Corseton rises a bone-white limestone cliff adorned with the cliff tombs of the ancient Milcorissian nobility, and atop it the Neratic Necropolis - a sprawling complex of temples, ossuaries, crypts and tombs stretching for miles along the cliff face and into the surrounding woodlands. At its center lies the High Hall of Judgment, heart of the Neratic faith, seat of Nerat's Council and the ultimate destination for bone pilgrimages from all over Cannor. But as vast as the sacred precinct is above ground, the Neratic priesthood ever-vigilant against necromantic defilement, it is even more expansive below. A network of catacombs and subterranean chapels has been hewn into the stone over the millennia, creating a veritable labyrinth. It is rumored that even the Neratic priesthood is not entirely familiar with the full extent of this maze, filled with corseted corpses, some of whom seem to be aware of every sign of movement disturbing their rest." 
 the_lake_palace:0 "The Lake Palace"
 the_lake_palace_desc:0 "------------\n Near the northern shores of Lake Themarenn sits the Grand Lake Palace, calmly watching over the city and the farm fields surrounding it.\n\nBuilt during the apex of the Kingdom of Esmaria, this palace is a monument to Esmarian ingenuity, splendor, and... decadence.\n\nLocated outside the reach of noisy streets and nosy priests and nobles of Esmaraine, the palace was originally built as a fort – some of the walls and infrastructure being interconnected with the modern castle of Themarenn to this day. However, its main purpose changed with time. As prosperity reigned over Esmaria during the 12th century, the palace was frequently used as a residence for the Kings of Esmaria and their entourage.\n\nThe structure itself was made in cooperation with gnomish engineers, dwarven smiths, and elven architects. Those who have been privileged enough to visit speak of its countless rooms of various sizes, no less than four kitchens, a wine cellar the size of a small town, gargantuan marble columns, and the magnificent Grand Courtroom in the middle of the building. Another famous part of the building, The King's Terrace overlooking the lake, was instead used for “less pressing matters” and additionally to entertain more prestigious guests.\n\nThe structure would however slowly wither away with the dissolution of the Kingdom and then the Grand Duchy of Esmaria. Many blueprints and finer details about the structure were lost, preventing its inheritors from properly maintaining it, but hope might yet not be lost as Cannor enters an Age of Rediscovery." 
 ciranmyna_the_shimmering_city:0 "Ciranmyna, the Shimmering City"
 ciranmyna_the_shimmering_city_desc:0 "------------\nUpon the tallest peaks of the Deepwoods shines Ciranmyna, the heart of Wood Elven culture and its mightiest shield. Having long outgrown its humble roots as a war camp filled with disheveled Moon Elves, the fortress city now sprawls across the mountaintop, woven into the very earth itself. Its towering walls watch over the few mines responsible for the Deepwood's scant supply of metals and gems. All the while a new army, one of eager artisans, works away to shape and craft weapons and goods greedily coveted by the forest’s denizens, nearby Escann and beyond." 
 mines_of_yfelorr:0 "The Mines of Yfelorr"
 mines_of_yfelorr_desc:0 "------------\nQuaintly nested within pleasant clearing filled with babbling brooks, lie the silver mines of Yfelorr. Uniquely fey-marked and inexorably tied to the Feyrealm, the mines have reliably provided the Deepwoods with precious metals thanks to its ever replenishing veins. In the centuries after the Verdant Veil's fall, development of the mine would discover it had more to offer than just silver..." 
 aksa_sanuyego:0 "Aksa Sanuyego"
 aksa_sanuyego_desc: "------------\nOn the western tip of the Lupulan Rainforest lies the great naval fortress of Aksa Sanuyego, the Citadel of the Flaming Leaf. Constructed under Jaher's orders, the great citadel served as a primary source of trade power for the Eastern Phoenix Empire and Arawkelin itself, ensuring safe passage between Sramaya and Tianlou. Though much of Jaher's legacy was squandered by his heirs, this fortress yet stands tall, as strong as that old conqueror's will."
 bal_vertesk:0 "Bal Vertesk"
 bal_vertesk_desc:0 "------------\nOver the Free City of Vertesk looms the Black Tower, a spire of sinister black brick. Originally, it was built by Balgar from the same pale stone as the famed White Walls. However, during his reign as master of the Vertesk Dominion, Venac the Arrogant corrupted the tower to its very foundations, turning its stones as black as night.\n\nThis tower has survived three empires and two millennia, a near-immortal symbol of fear and power. Countless lords of countless different peoples and petty kingdoms have all ruled from the same high solar, sent out the same agents with the same grim purpose: to vanish foolish dissenters behind the black spire’s yawning gates, their names never to be uttered aloud again.\n\nAs kings molder to dust and empires collapse like straw, the Black Tower stands as an uncaring testament set to outlive all, including the upstart Empire of Anbennar."
 bal_ouord:0 "Bal Ouord"
 bal_ouord_desc:0 "------------\nBuilt atop the same Burning Hills where the Castanites once battled the terrible First Gnoll Xhazobine, Bal Ouord's lone, gigantic central tower reaches far into the sky, serving as both the Citadel's main keep and lighthouse. Balgar the Builder, not content with merely building an unbreakable fortress, saw fit to carve for Bal Ouord a harbor surpassed only by that of nearby Ovdal Tûngr. Tunnels and hallways lead deep into the earth, converging upon a tremendous cavern against which the wind batters and the waves break. Bal Ouord's bowels may have never been host to wealthy merchant fleets, but at the height of the Empire of Castanor, they hosted an armada that saw even the prideful Damerian Republic flinch."
 bal_dostan:0 "Bal Dostan"
 bal_dostan_desc:0 "------------\nIn 470, the Raven King and his tribesmen stumbled on the abandoned citadel of Bal Dostan, its gates left wide open. In the high solar, the petty king found the Sapphire Key badge of the Bal Dostan castellans, and seized it as divine favor for his rule. For a time, the reign of the Korbarids was good.\n\nNowadays, their Corvurian descendants have the dubious honor of ruling over cow manure and dirt farmers. Arca Corvur’s vaults are beyond empty, the old Dragon Road that once enriched the Korbarid Kings worn into a mud trail for herding livestock.\n\nRecently, however, strange screeches are heard in the night above Corvuria. The yearly Masquerades, which shrunk slowly over the ages, now seem to never end. The endless feasts of Arca Corvur draw in impoverished nobles like flies. It is strange however: After leaving, the partiers say the best wine in the Godshield is found here, yet no one has ever seen a barrel  leave the palace…"
 bal_vroren:0 "Bal Vroren"
 bal_vroren_desc:0 "------------\nOne of Balgar's Wonders, the Citadel of Bal Vroren was built in 546 BA by the Empire of Castanor to defend against the Giants and their subjects to its north. Nestled in a natural harbor along the Giant's Grave Sea, Bal Vroren would come to serve as host to the fearsome Giantsbane Legion and as an important naval center and staging ground from which Castanor influenced the whole of Gerudia.\n\nDuring the events of the Dragonwake of 470 AA, centuries after its founding, tens of thousands of refugees would seek shelter in Bal Vroren's mighty walls. But when the dragon Elkaesal the White came to the Citadel's gates, all of them would be frozen to death overnight. Ever since that harrowing event, Bal Vroren has attracted rumors of curses and hauntings and has been left abandoned, with its ruined walls, towers, and keeps serving as grim reminder of the terror that once afflicted Cannor.\n\nSeeing Bal Vroren refurbished and fully manned would require significant effort, and it is so thoroughly scarred and marred by would-be conquerors and invaders that most now believe it can never be fully restored. If even a measure of Bal Vroren's former glory were to be regained, however, it is certain that Cannor and Gerudia would again be divided by the towering, impenetrable heights of the Vrorenswall..."
 bal_hyl:0 "Bal Hyl"
 bal_hyl_desc:0 "------------\nDuring the Dragonwake, three Alenic Tribes fled pell-mell into the eastern Dameshead. With Gawedi behind, and Damerians ahead, they turned to fight before the noose closed completely. In a desperate gambit, they put Bal Hyl at their backs and armed every man, woman and child. The Battle of the Hyl was so grave that their backline was crushed against the castle walls.\n\nAfterwards, the castellan of Bal Hyl offered vassalage but refused the tribesmen sanctuary. Surprisingly, the Wex played along: scouts had found entrance into tunnels beneath Bal Hyl. As talks stalled above, warriors delved deeper below.\n\nWhen Damenath fell, Wexonard braves boiled through the catacombs and slaughtered the demoralized garrison. In victory, the Wex chieftain cast the Damerian flag onto the pyre of his enemies, naming his conquest Wexkeep.\n\nNow, the House sil Wex rules Wexkeep with an iron fist. The same labyrinth that doomed the Damerians houses both supplies and spies, the full extent thereof known only to the sil Wex line. The descendants of those bloodsoaked braves still man the walls."
 bal_mire:0 "Bal Mire"
 bal_mire_desc:0 "------------\nBal Mire was built in 457 BA, in the marshlands of western Escann, to watch over the unruly Alenic tribes to the west, long a thorn in Castanor's side. Acting as a bridge over the Alen River as well as a fortress, Bal Mire is the youngest and smallest of Balgar's Wonders. Some joke that all of Balgar's spirit had been spent on his other works, but the truth regarding Bal Mire's diminutive size lies in the uneasy ground it rests upon. Raising a fortress in such a dreadful location had been deemed impossible, and that Balgar did so without affecting the Citadel's ability to serve as an impenetrable gateway was nothing short of a miracle – one that secured Castanor's dominion over the whole of the Middle Alen."
 the_north_citadel:0 "The North Citadel"
 the_north_citadel_desc:0 "------------\nBuilt at the base of the Trialmount, the North Citadel served as the court of Castanor's emperors for centuries. It was from here that they would begin their journey up the Trialmount, undertaking the Trials of Castan, and it was from here that many Castans ruled over one of the greatest empires the world has ever seen and will ever see.\n\nAlthough the Great Aqueduct linking the North Citadel to the City of Castonath has been destroyed and the Citadel itself damaged during the Battle of Trialmount, the North Citadel remains whole. If the Court of Castan were to be restored and its halls once again crowded and roaring with life, perhaps some measure of the Empire of Castanor's former glory can yet be found."
 aelcandar:0 "Aelcandar"
 aelcandar_desc:0 "------------\nAelcandar, another great work by Calasandur the Magnificent, was built to counter Nichmer’s terror campaign against the Wescanni halflings. The guardsmen fought night and day to rebuff countless undead, grievously exhausted and injured. The stronghold was pivotal for the Free Realms cavalry, offering refuge when the slavering hordes grew too large. \n\nAelcandar’s name resounds among all Wescann halflings, especially the Coppertowners. Central to Aelcandar's fame is Candor Ale, a glimmering pale spirit only brewed in Coppertown copper kettles, and widely loved for its sweet flavor and deceptive potency. \n\nThe surrounding lands are home still to the half-elven Aelcandari, descendants of the original Free Realms garrison. Initially enforcers for Viswall, the Aelcandari have fought and died protecting halflings in every Wescanni war. Nowadays, Aelcandari share much with their shorter brothers, espousing the same love for adventure, pipeweed and good food. Though kin to the smallfolk, the Aelcandari serve a mixed purpose as both protector and jailer over the halflings of Lencenor."
 escandar:0 "Escandar"
 escandar_desc:0 "------------\nEscandar has always guarded contested territory. It was first built by the famed Calasandur the Magnificent as steward of the pass through the Khenak Mountains. As the main fortress separating The Borders and Businor, it served to keep Businor’s gnoll infestation out of the southeastern Dameshead.\n\nEscandar has famously changed hands many times. During the War of the Sorcerer King, the Wexonard warlord Magda síl Magda was appointed to rule from the citadel, as duchess of the short-lived Duchy of Escandar. In the time of Jaher’s conquests, Escandar was a stronghold for his early conquests in Southeast Cannor. When the Busilari Interregnum led to patchwork civil wars between countless petty kings and squabbling warlords, Escandar was a safe harbor for all peoples.\n\nIn modern times, Escandar retains its original role of keeping the diminished Hillthrone gnoll packs at bay. Courtiers grumble that its garrison should finally wipe out the pests, and be reassigned to better things…"
 calascandar:0 "Calascandar"
 calascandar_desc:0 "------------\nWho doesn’t know the legend of the crafty hero Calasandur the Magnificent and his most famous castle Calascandar? Strategically positioned to protect North Esmaria and the old Havoric lands, it is famed for holding back an invasion from Black Castanor, giving the Free Realms time to break the siege and open the way into Escanni heartlands.\n\nCalascandar is a name famed throughout the Empire of Anbennar as the site of the founding of the famed Knights Magnificent and the original headquarters of the Calasanni Trading Company. Calasandur himself ruled from this fortress as founder of the affluent House of Silcalas, one of the brightest and most fecund Silver families of the Empire.\n\nNowadays, Calascandar still safeguards the Ainsway, an immensely profitable trade route, but the CLSTC has since moved their headquarters to Damescrown. The now sidelined Calascandar CSLTC branch eyes the new headquarters with anger, but they continue their duty of turning one coin into two."
 humacs_tomb:0 "Humac's Tomb"
 humacs_tomb_desc:0 "------------\nFather of Castan I the Progenitor, Humac was a foundational hero and military commander of the Castanites, leading his troops to victory in countless battles until he was personally slain by the First Xhazobine at the Battle of the Burning Hill. His son Castan, not wanting his father's corpse and resting place defiled by the gnolls, carried his remains all the way through the Lost Years in the Deepwoods until they finally found friendly lands. There he buried his father, along with all of his possessions save his holy mace, which he kept for himself.\n\nAs neither Castan I nor Castan II left any mortal remains behind, Humac's Tomb became the most significant burial monument from the early Castanorian era, and many later Castans would embellish the Tomb over the years, until it was finally destroyed by the Greentide. Many Escanni believe that just as "elves" are named after Venaan, the word "human" comes from Humac."

 balkhangfa_palace:0 "Balkhangfa Palace"
 balkhangfa_palace_desc:0 "------------\nHigh up on the slopes of Dragon Peak, the Balkhangfa Palace is the cultural, political, and spiritual center of the Goldscale Kobolds. The palace is built both onto and into the mountain and rises on multiple levels along its steep flanks. Its outward center is a spacious plaza on the roof of its central wing that is situated in front of a pair of massive bronze gates sealing the cave from which, according to legend, the golden dragon Balris once emerged.\n\nBehind these gates, the cave has been turned into a massive entrance hall decorated with countless murals and ornamental carvings fit for a draconic god-king by the tireless effort of generations of kobolds. Further into the mountain, a resplendent throne room and living quarters, including a hot spring spacious enough for a dragon, can be found. Beyond these massive chambers and ostentatious hallways, a network of tunnels, cramped corridors, vestibules, and cubicles occupy the remainder of the palace. They are used by the many clerks, priests, and workers who keep the complex machinery of the state running smoothly."

 bladeskeep_monument_desc:0 "--------------\nSitting atop of Dragonsbane hill, the mighty Bladeskeep is a symbol of the glory days of Old Escann. It served as the training ground for some of Cannor’s greatest warriors, who swore loyalty to §OCalindal, the Gleaming Blade§! and were entrusted to protect her, those amongst the warriors of the Keep who showed a great deal of martial proves would become worthy of wielding the sword, becoming thus the Stewards of the Blade.\nThe Bladeskeep was founded by Elecast Dragonsbane, who was hailed as Blade King in 499 for his slaying of Alos the Copper.\n\nThe Bladeskeep saw many periods of decadence and prosperity along the years, training generations of soldiers and generals that served throughout Escann and beyond. It was not until recently that the Keep saw an event that shook it to its core:  §OCalindal, the Gleaming Blade§! destroyed during the Greentide, a traumatic event for this ancient institution.

 ascajar_desc:0 "--------------\nNestled within the verdant coastal hill range of Busilar and overlooking prosperous Port Jaher at the mouth of the Hapainé, the palace of Ascajar is truly deserving of its moniker ‘Citadel of Flowers’.\n\nIts origins can be traced to a fortification erected in 488 AA by the rulers of Kišakur to secure their control over the vital port of Abtanus, which would later become Port Jaher. After their descendants secured their hold over Businor, the fortress was first expanded, then demolished in 672 AA. In its place the palace of Azka-Ayaru, or Citadel of Flowers, was erected and became the royal palace of Itrahureš for the following two centuries. Around 750AA,  the famed gardens of Ascajar were first established.\n\nAfter the fall of Itrahureš, Ascajar lost its prominence for a time under the rule of Black Castanor, but it was restored to its former glory under the Phoenix Empire and has since served as the favorite royal retreat of the ruling Silnara dynasty of Busilar.\n\nThe intricately decorated interior of the palace and its soaring architecture, built in the unique Ilatani style, are remarkable enough on their own, but even they are overshadowed by the vast palace gardens, sprawling across a series of terraces surrounding the palace. A network of pools and fountains ensure a balmy clime even during the heat of the summer months and a stunning array of flowers from places as far away as Fangaula and Rahen bloom year round.\n\nHere the spirit of Itrahureš lives on: combining disparate cultures to create something better, stronger and infinitely more beautiful."

 jag_radash_monument_desc:0 "--------------\nJag'Radash - ‘Brave Battle’ in Orcish - marks the centre of a vast hunting ground, set up in the wake of a population boom amongst some of the wilder animals after the Greentide swept across Escann. Traditional hunters across Human and Orc lines were busy in the fighting or fleeing depending on the phase of the conflict, and in their absence, natural predators proliferated. Now that the dust has settled and Orcish control over this area has been cemented, their kingdoms seen as equal to the Cannorians, this natural oasis of wildlife has been marked out,  safe from destruction as a primitive or monstrous aberration, should it ever be occupied by the 'civilised' realms. Orcs train against the wilds and bond with their fellows, gaining experience with the dangers of the wild without risking the full violence of battle."

After leading their violent escape from captivity and spending time in the service of Jaher, Ladrinel returned to the Elfrealm of Ibevar, having spent more time apart from it than Ibevar had yet formally existed. She brought to bear her experiences as a famous general and adept of martial techniques, founding one of Cannor's most prestigious military institutions before retiring around the end of Prince Adrahel's reign.\n\nSince then, Blaíddscal has taught generations of officers from Ibevar and occasionally guests from further abroad, boasting a teaching staff intended to give a well rounded but military minded schooling, often hand-selected from previous generations of exemplary officers. Sometimes even mercenary adepts of Diranbe, known as Rhaidd, coming and being given a home in the gentle lands of the Elfrealm in return for teaching services. Many walk through its halls and come out ready to serve a truly modern army and build discipline from top down."

City politics saw the noble court of the síl Vis stuck into a push-and-pull relation with city hall and its burghers allies. A solution was found when, in typical halfling fashion, both sides were brought together: the buildings, situated on opposite banks of the river, became the dual launches for a unified bridge-palace, one governmental complex from which to govern both the city and the Kingdom. The Rainbow Hall remained the iconic symbol of the city until its destruction during the Viswall Rebellion.\n\nOn the northern bank rests the Fuchsia Commons complex, city hall of Viswall, and from it a dwarven made bridge of white stone straddles the Widderoy.

It was not enough to stop the desertification of the Epednan Expanse however, and when the Sarda migrated eastward, they took it with them.

They are often not seen again.\n\nSome would say that the vines crawling up the sides of the lighthouse are drawn to it just the same, but that might just be imagination."

As one ascends the crumbling stairway inside, one is met with the radiant visages of long vanished precursors adorning the walls.\n\nThose who dare make the climb will bear witness to the otherworldly plant life that twists along the walls of a grand laboratory, still intact after centuries of abandonment.

The figure stands with his arms outstretched, as if both welcoming travellers and proclaiming his glory. Ebenanth, the First Emperor, notoriously annihilated the statue’s head with his Relic-Staff, Starshear – any trace of the statue’s maker vanished with it.\n\nAs Kottar Orenkoraim transformed into the last free port of Taychend, and a packed, sprawling city was built around the statue, the Gathyanavaida would be the first glimpse of the region most Cannorians saw, a symbol of the boundless pride and glorious futility of Taychendi history."

As the hags drain its sap, this bleak energy is absorbed by the environment, feeding off the tree as it feeds off the Shadow Plane.

The third; the military district. In this district one finds innumerable barracks and training grounds, the officer schools, and the garrison that cast their watchful eyes across the surrounding hills. From the skies, they can monitor for miles in every direction for threat, harassing enemy movements with easy retreat in the case of danger. The fourth and final level; the Queen's Palace and the administration. It is from here that the Queendom is run; representatives of both the flocks and the non-harpies meet and petition the Queen in these halls.

This westernmost peak of the Paravimvata range has long held a place of particular importance in Bulwari cosmogeography - first as the sacred mountain of the Erbatraši Brasan the Emancipator, and since the Divine Herald Jaddar ascended its heights and received his revelations from Surael Himself, as the Mountain of Clear Sight.\n\nThe mountain itself is riddled with the remains of an opulent djinn palace whose owner, like all of their kind, vanished during the Day of Ashen Skies. The ruins were shunned by superstitious Mašnsih and only sporadically entered by harpy squatters until Andrellion of the Desert Legion was brought here by his harpy allies and made the ruins his headquarters, naming it the ‘Mukdaious Malas’ or Palace of Hidden Waters. With the rise of the Jadd, the djinn palace has been restored and expanded as the spiritual and political center of the Jaddari Legion.\n\nThe palace contains many grand halls carved from the rock, terraces offering awe-inspiring views and secluded gardens watered by springs wished into existence by its original occupant. Beyond the palace, a monastery of the Daughters of Jasiene called the ‘Nahytialzal Telaja’ - Refuge of Radiant Revelation - has been established. Several caravanserais serve the many pilgrims present at all times, with some even attempting to ascend the Endless Stair, a series of stairs carved into the mountain ending in a colossal platform erected atop a lesser peak, from which the pilgrims can view the sun rising over the summit of Ebbušubtu where Jaddar received his revelations."

 quartz_cothon_desc:0 "--------------\nThe coast of the Far Salahad along the Gulf of Rahen is a desolate and forbidding landscape. Sand dunes and stony arid plains stretch from the shore to the horizon. But hidden among this barren coastline is a true marvel. A day's travel east from the coastal town of Daqalm, the barren cliffs along the coast are separated by a broad channel, hidden from view by strategically placed rock outcroppings until a ship is almost right upon it. A vessel entering this channel will soon arrive at a perfectly circular gargantuan harbor, capable of hosting an entire fleet. This is the fabled Quartz Cothon.\n\nIts wharves, buildings and walkways are fashioned not from the local sandstone but from blindingly white marble, inlaid with massive veins of quartz. These quartz veins form perfectly geometrical patterns and lend the cothon its name. Opposite the channel entrance, a white marble tower, almost delicate despite its size, stretches towards the sky and overlooks the harbor. All along the harbor front, basins are carved into the marble, easily adaptable as drydocks. And surrounding the cothon on all sides are buildings with an austere beauty supported by towering marble columns. Despite their finely wrought construction, these buildings appear to be intended as shipyards and storehouses for raw materials and trade goods alike.\n\n Who created this marvel - Djinn, God-king or other entity - has been lost to the mists of time, and the cothon itself has been discovered and then abandoned during times of conflict multiple times over the millennia. Yet whenever it has been freed from the shifting sand dunes that tend to bury it when left unattended, it is undeniably the finest harbor in the westernmost Gulf of Rahen."

Once the site of a grandiose Djinn palace during the time of the Darkness Sultanates,  the palace of Proxacha Eklu was erected on its ruins during the Age of Monsters, as the heart of the gnollish capital of Raxaklu. After the fall of the gnollish kingdom, the palace ruins stood untouched for many centuries due to the superstitious fear and resentment of the local human Bulwari, the city around it eventually razed to the ground by the Red Xhaz. Only after Jaher liberated Bulwar was the area finally resettled again.\n\nEledas Sarelzuir founded Sareyand and built a palace on the hill overlooking his new city, incidentally choosing the location of both previous palace complexes. This palace would earn the epithet ‘Ash Palace’ after a failed assassination attempt left the palace a charred ruin and a young Jexis, the later Phoenix Empress, disfigured for life. After the first Cinder War,a limited reconstruction began, aimed at rendering one wing of the sprawling palace complex inhabitable again as an official residence of the Sarelzuir dynasty.\n\nDespite a checkered history in the last several centuries, the Ash Palace has over the millennia been chosen again and again as the seat of empires, its location making it a natural choice for anyone wishing to rule all of Bulwar and beyond. And like embers within the ashes, the fires of conquest can easily be rekindled by anyone seated on the sunfire throne of the Ash Palace."

 eduz_ginakku_desc:0 "--------------\nOn the northern shore of the Saluraš, connected to old Aqatbar by Kalešin’s Bridge, lies the temple city of Eduz-Ginakku, also called the Great Library of Aqatbar by foreigners. While the true origins of the temple-library are uncertain, many favor the theory that it was Birsartan the Scribe, who brought the Sun Cult to Bahar, who founded the temple.\n\nOver the centuries, Eduz-Ginakku grew to include not only the central temple complex, but also countless scriptoria, libraries, and workshops, as well as housing for the clergy. The temple-garden surrounding the central Ziggurat with its famed Altar of the Truth is unique as well, as papyrus reeds and a vast array of flowers used in the production of ink dyes are grown there, instead of the more traditionally grown decorative plants. One quarter of the library district is occupied by Zheh’s palace-fortress, built by the gnollish matriarch Zheh who came to Aqatbar for plunder but fell in love with the amassed knowledge found in Eduz-Ginakku and became a famed patron of the literary arts.\n\nEduz-Ginakku has been one of if not the most prominent center of scholarship and learning in all of Bulwar, and has been the undisputed religious center of eastern Bahar for millennia. It is here where Cannorians desiring to sip from the fountain of wisdom of Bulwari civilization come to broaden their horizons."

 aur_kes_akasik_desc:0 "--------------\nCarved into the face of the mighty Akasi mountains is an ancient palace from a bygone era. It was one of many palaces created and held by the giants, until the mighty Storm Queens overthrew them with the help of the Fangaulan king Aro. After expelling the giants from Akasik, the Storm Queens reshaped the once unassuming palace into the greatest in North Sarhal; the mountains themselves were molded to form new chambers of the palace and grant it the eternal embrace of the mother. The Storm Queens brought forth many fresh springs from the earth to create wondrous gardens and an ever-running hydraulic system, and set in place powerful enchantments that still stir spring breezes through the many open spaces of the palace. While before the splintering of Akasik the palace was the primary court of many kings and queens, in recent times it has served as a pilgrimage site for the faithful and the planetouched of Akasik, bringing a semblance of centralization to an otherwise splintered faith."

 tree_of_tales_desc:0 "--------------\nTowering high above the steaming canopy of the northern reaches of the Dao Nako, the Yirisunsiir or Tree of Tales forms the heart of the town of Jirad. An ancient solitary ironwood tree, the Yirisunsiir has existed since at least the times of the first Fangaulan empire. \n\nNestled within its many boughs are a host of platforms, stages, chambers and gathering halls connected by a network of stairs, ladders and rope bridges, which host the preeminent school for the Jelli – the famed Fangaulan bardic poets and storytellers. Here they come together from all over Fangaula and beyond in yearly gatherings to share tales from distant lands and novel songs. The walls of the main assembly hall are decorated by murals depicting famous tales from Fangaulan myths, made from precious wood and iridescent pearl inlays created out of Makans gift, large freshwater river pearls found in the Nkolonnin river. \n\nThe Tree of Tales is however not only a place of learning for the next generation of Jelli, but also the final resting place for many Jelli, particularly those of Kaino descent. The outermost branches of the Yirisunsiir are covered in scaffolds used for air burials. Once their remains have been stripped of all flesh they are cremated and the ashes strewn into Makans pool, a sacred wellspring at the base of the tree, whose waters flow into the mighty Nkolonnin, allowing the souls of the Jelli to continue traveling even after death."

 dendugma_monastery_desc:0 "--------------\nTowering over the humid jungles of the Dao Nako and the sweltering plains and volcanic highlands of Janama, the imposing Junansuar volcano dominates the landscape of western Fangaula. About half-way to its crater peak, a series of walls and fortifications hewn from its basalt stone surround the entire mountain. These protect the sacred temples of the Dendugma forge-priests, sworn to the service of the divine blast furnace Mojobaa, as well as the headquarters of the God’s Atoners, whose sacred duty it is to control all the planetouched of Fangaula.\n\nA vast network of forges arranged on terraced levels makes use of the heat rising up from within Junansuar to shape hardy ironwood into Dendugma steel, crafting durable tools and dreadful weapons alike. It was here where Biakata received the weaponry for her army that would go on to conquer all of Fangaula. Burrowed deep within the volcano are the remnants of an ancient Efreet palace. Only the topmost layers of this complex have been occupied by the Dendugma order and turned into the central sanctum of their faith, with entry to deeper levels forbidden as to not disturb the lava children of Mojobaa.\n\nSince the time of Biakata, the Dendugma are no longer the only holy order calling the volcano home. Here the God’s Atoners have their barracks, training grounds, administrative headquarters and, buried deep within the dark rock, their ínfamous dungeons, where even the most powerful and tenacious planetouched are eventually broken." 
 imperial_arena:0 "Great Imperial Arena" 
 imperial_arena_desc:0 "--------------\nAt the heart of Sinjetaso - the province itself named for this most famous institution - lies the sprawling Great Arena. Despite the name, it is not a singular building but a vast complex of arenas, gladiatorial barracks, animal pens and assorted infrastructural buildings, a veritable city within a city, all warded by a monumental adobe brick wall surrounding the complex.\n\nFounded by Biakata the Great, it is in this arena where for centuries the most martially inclined planetouched have battled for supremacy in thrilling gladiatorial matches. Using their unique abilities and complex enchantments woven into the building blocks of the arenas themselves, all manners of unique combat scenarios can be experienced by the gladiators - aerial battles, subaquatic struggles, melee clashes in an arena set on fire or in which the ground itself tries to swallow the fighters. Here planetouched warriors can measure their abilities against each other and dangerous animals imported from all over Sarhal, all in pursuit of the ephemeral title of Champion of the Arena.\n\nThe Great Arena serves not only to entertain the masses, but is has also been used to recognize and train suitably belligerent planetouched for service in the imperial armies, execute planetouched traitors against the empire and, maybe most importantly, focus the ambition and aggression of planetouched on these lethal competitions, instead of on attempts to carve out their own fiefdoms."

At its heart, hidden behind a labyrinth of sandstone canyons, lies the blue marvel of the desert, the Oasis of Water Dreams: a network of clear spring pools whose water nourishes a verdant paradise in this otherwise inhospitable land. Shielded from the glare of the desert sun by the surrounding steep cliffs, it has since time immemorial been a refuge and place of rest for all who traverse these parts of the Salahad.\n\nCalled Jisugo Loban by the Mukarron tribe native to these lands, and Gortarkhitanda by their gnollish overlords, the Oasis of Water Dreams is not only a vital resupply stop for all who wish to traverse the unforgiving desert, but also the home of an ancient temple complex that is sacred to all, be they Fangaulan, Akasi or Gnoll. Hewn into the cliff faces surrounding the oasis are easily defendable access points to the subterranean network of temples and sanctuaries carved into the sandstone over the past millennia.\n\nThe flowers blooming on the shore of the oasis ponds provide the pollen used by a hardy species of desert bee to produce a unique hallucinogenic honey, a treasured ritual substance for religious ceremonies held in the oasis temple and beyond. Guarding this unique sanctuary since before the rise of the second Fangaulan Empire are the Bermine Basugo, the Guides of the Dream, an order of planetouched sworn to defend the sanctity of the temples of Jisugo Loban and all who seek shelter there."

 e_arenaginku_adras_desc:0 "-------------\nOne of the many different homes made for the dragon Zenidir before his martyrdom, E Arenaginku Adras (“The Emerald Hall") is aptly named for its emerald walls carved with various stories and traditional tales. Built into the side of Gleti Sedara, from here Zenidir was able to both survey the land in the area and host his nobles for various purposes, be that the government of the kingdom or simple entertainment. The most famous of its offerings was its izenwez (‘shepherd's-ball’) pit. Izenwez is played by two teams of seven men armed with shepherds crooks, using them to whip a fist sized colored ball made of hard calf skin into a small alcove on the opposite side of a long stone pit. In the centuries since the collapse of his empire, much has been looted, leaving nothing more than an empty husk used in a limited capacity by local shepards. If we are to return the hall to its former glory and revive the game again at a national level, we will need to invest much into refurbishing the hall."

It was built in the 1200s, with reddish purple stone transmuted by Azmera himself from the soil surrounding the tower. Within its walls he vigorously researched methods of transmutation and abjuration, becoming the foremost master in the region if not the continent. Its walls sit filled with stone tablets covered in research and notes on the application and study of the various schools of magic, though the most impressive of objects sits unfinished within the central tower. “E Yayerneta Shema”, the Weather Weaver, is an unfinished loom almost the height of the tower that was supposed to be Azmera's magnum opus, and would have allowed him to exert extremely fine control of field and weather spells. Even in its unfinished state, it massively speeds the production of the metal infused cloth for which the city is famous. If a particularly powerful mage were to arrive again, surely it could achieve its original purpose."

 #dwarovar Monuments
 dd_frogarsalforn_desc:0 "--------------\n The wide, carved tunnels of an old street come together to form a juncture. At their intersection, a long split creeps down from the vaulted ceiling and opens a tear within the once smooth wall of the crosswise passage. Through the weathered crack flickers what appears to be candlelight, which pours through and bleeds onto the rubble at the base of the hole. In the pile of broken rocks are cracked tablets, intricately carved with the language of ancient dwarves. Peering through the eroded portal, one discovers small idols of marble, and many rows of shelves of scrolls and tablets. Old knowledge – rife for the taking."
 dd_leforn_desc:0 "--------------\nIn the days of Aul-Dwarov, hidden retreats such as this one were not uncommon. Pockets of subterranean paradise such as the grotto before this aged embellished door, however, were. It is quite strange then, that the eccentric seamster who lived here so long ago decided to ugly up the natural beauty with his bare and now oxidized brass mannequins, whose corpses litter the grove floor. Nobles of yore were wont to get away from the pomp and circumstance of civilized living to retreat and tinker at their leisure. Whoever lived here went far out of their way to do so."
 dd_stunveigryorth_desc:0 "--------------\nFound beyond a narrow gap, the lithic treetops of an immense stone forest form the floor of Stunveigryôrth. Surprisingly, the canopy-floor is sturdy enough to hold considerable weight, despite being pocked with gaps. Between the ossified gnarls of ancient wood, one can begin to trace the branches back toward the trunk by lantern light. Every now and then, from the narrow pockets of darkness between the leaves, a shimmer or two hums up from below. What life lives below is wholly undiscovered."
 dd_dimlherd_desc:0 "------------\nThis abandoned complex, full of rusting and decrepit machinery, broken pipes leaking magma, and ancient runic contraptions, is constructed in a highly volcanically-active area of the Serpentspine. Its ultimate purpose remains to be seen, though some theorise that perhaps it was intended to supply the whole of Aul-Dwarov through geothermal activity - though exactly what would require such a massive facility to even function remains a mystery. White-hot lava flows, sudden magma floods, geysers of flame, and blankets of choking volcanic gases are just some of the dangers our adventurers will have to contend with - and that is without reckoning with the flora and fauna that lurk within."
 dd_grumhardhum_desc:0 "------------\n Grumhardhûm, a truly legendary site, was said to have been the Great Forge of the Dwarovar, constructed by Aul-Dwarov in the days of yore. During Aul-Dwarov’s height, when the dwarves ruled from Krakdhûmvror to Verkal Dromak, it is said that the greatest heroes of Aul-Dwarov were armed and shod with the finest equipment and weapons, fresh-forged by the greatest of dwarven craftsmen and runesmiths. These days the forge lies abandoned and in a state of decay and disrepair, and is doubtless infested with all manner of dangerous creatures, but surely the chance to recover any treasure that remains within - and the power that treasure would undoubtedly possess - is worth the risk?"

This was a time when Aul-Dwarov needed innovative means to defeat some ancient foe. Are the bones that litter the path to this structure the scars of war, or a terrible discovery? What exactly this laboratory’s previous inhabitants discovered that was so worthy of protection remains to be seen."
 dd_wyltramvar_desc:0 "--------------\nWhat was once just a mineshaft has become an intriguing site of excavation after miners blasted out a wall, discovering a tunnel they had not dug themselves.

However, the direction and shape of the tunnel seems to suggest it was dug from the other side, up and toward the known world from below."

Speculators assert the chasm runs straight to the Serpentspine’s depths, a claim that can only be substantiated by scaling its walls."
 dd_yidablaerun_desc:0 "--------------\nA gargantuan cave network spreads out from the end of an unassuming tunnel, leading in all sorts of directions.

As they gather around the opening, adventurers and explorers all murmur the same question, with a name they dare only speak in hushed, fearful whispers - is this the home of Yidab, the legendary arachnid Broodmother of the Serpentspine, and her children?"

It has stood in this place unblemished for thousands upon thousands of years, dating back to the very first lizardfolk empire. It stands as a reminder that no matter how many civilisations rise and fall, the lizardfolk will remain, waiting for the prophesied 333th and final empire to unite all lizardfolk and rule for eternity, just as the Center of Heavens too stands for eternity."

The base of the spire remains intact and forms the central castle and watchtower.

These Deep Devils sank many of the island cities, with only this towering spire, half submerged by the sea, standing as a reminder of their existence. The remains of the Zatsarya, including the passageways inside of the spire that are underwater, have been repurposed as a city for the merfolk of the South Sarhal Coast."

Most remarkably of all, what one can see is only the very top of the spire. Deep underground lie layers upon layers of un-excavated floors of this great structure. How it sank is unknown, but its discovery prompted a rush of interest in what treasures could lie at its deepest levels."
