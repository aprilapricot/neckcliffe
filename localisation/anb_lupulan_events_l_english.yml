#Events
lupulan_events.1000.t: "King Of The Jungle"
lupulan_events.1000.d.1: "Since the jungle was a collection of seedlings, we of the Lupulan have made it our home. We attempt to live in balance with all things, from the other tribes of the jungle to the great spirits which guide us in so many ways. The overseer of all balance and everything is the Sri Baginda, King of Kings. It is the Sri Baginda’s job to create order from the bickering tribes and the fickle spirits, to ensure that our way of life in the Lupulan may continue. This is the way it should be, anyway.\n\nNot all is well in the jungle. The Lupulan is under threat from the pirates of Pinghoi, who treat the Sri Baginda’s rule as an obstacle and the spirits as menaces. The Sri Baginda of Jaya Raya stands defeated, and their orders fall on deaf ears while their calls for tribute go unanswered. What good is a king with no subjects?"
lupulan_events.1000.d.2: "The tribes of the Lupulan are notoriously reclusive. We know very little of them: only that they worship the spirits of the jungle and that their tribes are united in a loose confederation under a chief they call the “Sri Baginda”, whom they believe holds legitimate rule over all the Lupulan.\n\nUnfortunately for them, their Sri Baginda is being squeezed from all sides. Sedition from within and invading armies from the outside world have made the Sri Baginda into a king without a kingdom. Their disarray provides us with a great opportunity: let us bring civilization to them quickly before they manage to regroup."
lupulan_events.1000.a: "We enter uncertain times..."
lupulan_events.1000.b: "All the Lupulan will be ours!"
lupulan_events.1001.t: "Invader From Beyond"
lupulan_events.1001.d: "[sri_baginda_attacker.GetName] has declared war on [sri_baginda_help.GetName]. They have sent an envoy to our palace to remind us of our obligation as Sri Baginda to defend them against outside invaders, and have requested that we deploy our troops to the line of battle as soon as possible."
lupulan_events.1001.a: "We march to war!"
lupulan_events.1001.b: "Perhaps it is time we gave up the crown."
lupulan_events.1002.t: "The Jungle Chief"
lupulan_events.1002.d: "Our campaign to subjugate the Lupulan has encountered a new obstacle. The tribe we seek to conquer appears to be subject of some backwards kind of Jungle Chief, and their armies march to battle to repel our attack on their subject."
lupulan_events.1002.a: "How pitiful."
lupulan_events.1002.b: "Who even let their messenger in here?"
lupulan_events.1003.t: "Death Of A Fallen"
lupulan_events.1003.d: "Upon the death of a Sri Baginda, the rulers of the Lupulan convene to elect a new Sri Baginda. Usually, this process is a formality, as the heir of the Sri Baginda serves as the obvious choice.\n\nHowever, the recent actions of our state have led to a degradation of our status in the eyes of the rest of the world, to the degree that the selection of our new ruler as Sri Baginda would be seen as a declaration of weakness and an invitation to outsiders to interfere in the Lupulan. For this reason, the others have chosen a new candidate as Sri Baginda."
lupulan_events.1003.a: "We will claim it back..."
lupulan_events.1004.t: "The Humiliation of [Root.GetName]"
lupulan_events.1004.d: "The loss in our recent war against [From.GetName] appears to have been the last event in a rule increasingly marked by weakness and disarray. They have staged a grand parade in their capital, and their [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has given a grand speech in which they have declared our weakness and their new rule as Sri Baginda, King of Kings. Already, the envoys of the others flock to give tribute."
lupulan_events.1004.a: "Those fools will discover the trials of rulership soon enough"
lupulan_events.1005.t: "Dissolution Of The Sri Baginda"
lupulan_events.1005.d: "The Lupulan is alive, but it is not unchanging. Where once the title of Sri Baginda held sway or at least respect from all kings of the Lupulan, the title is nowadays defined by absence: absence of power, absence of influence, and absence of relevance. The crown lies in the gutter, but no one can be bothered to pick it up."
lupulan_events.1005.a: "We move forward, willingly or not"
lupulan_events.1006.t: "Facts of Life"
lupulan_events.1006.d: "The one thing that can be said to be a constant of life in the Lupulan is the drone of the jungle. It acts as a constant backdrop to the rhythms of the Lupulan, and we could not imagine life without it.\n\nIn the same way, our rule has become a part of the Lupulan. The vassals pay tribute, all the Lupulan bends the knee, and we are a part of the jungle as much as the noise. We have repelled the pirates, the tribes of the plains, and the zealots of High Philosophy. Their populations do not resist, for the Lupulan itself is on our side. We are a fact of life."
lupulan_events.1006.a: "We have built an empire to stand the test of time"
lupulan_events.1007.t: "Fruits Of Our Labor"
lupulan_events.1007.d: "Life in the Lupulan is full of festivals and celebrations, but few of these festivals are as satisfying as the presentation of the grand tribute.\n\nWatching our subjects’ emissaries select every word with the utmost care and compete to bow the deepest, it is impossible not to notice the difference good leadership makes. In older days, the presentation of grand tribute to the Sri Baginda was a duty given to the most junior and useless courtiers, and the tribute itself was assembled haphazardly and often embezzled from. Now the kings of the Lupulan send their most resplendent diplomats to bestow upon us wonders: they desire not only our grand protection, but to be a part of our glory, however small.\n\nOur predecessors as Sri Baginda were incompetents, fools who dirtied their crown as they rolled about in mud. It has not been easy to restore the title of Sri Baginda, but it is moments like these that make our effort worth it"
lupulan_events.1007.a: "It's good to be king"
lupulan_events.1008.t: "King of Kings"
lupulan_events.1008.d: "The title of Sri Baginda is a promise as much as it is an epithet. It is a promise to our vassals that our rule will be wise and just, to the spirits that our kingship is righteously guided, and to our people that the Lupulan will be theirs forevermore. The Sri Bagindas of old made a mockery of this promise, but through generations of kingship and glory we have proclaimed to the world that we intend to honor our duties. This is why all the Lupulan bends the knee.\n\nOur vassals come readily to us to resolve their disputes, convinced that our decision will be fair. The Lupulan and its spirits watch over our rule, convinced that we honor the balance of human and spirit. Our people live ordered and prosperous lives, convinced that our rule is legitimate. All is as it should be and as it will be forever, so long as we keep our promise."
lupulan_events.1008.a: "Glory to the Sri Baginda, King of Kings!"
lupulan_events.1009.t: "A New Lord"
lupulan_events.1009.d.1: "We did not expect much from the death of the old Sri Baginda. The way it has always been is that the heir of the Sri Baginda is chosen to carry on their legacy. This time, however, there were whispers. The other tribes whispered to us that the palace of the Sri Baginda had fallen into disarray. They whispered to us of decadence and weakness.\n\nWhen the time for the election came, those whispers became votes for our rule cast in plain speech. We have been tasked with kingship over all of the Lupulan as Sri Baginda, King of Kings."
lupulan_events.1009.d.2: "Upon the death of a Sri Baginda, the tribes of the Lupulan convene to choose their successor. The way it has always been is that the heir of the Sri Baginda is chosen to carry on their legacy, but this time was different.\n\nAfter talking to the other tribes, we reached a consensus that a change was needed, and we banded together with the other tribes to elect another to the office. Over the screams of the Sri Baginda’s idiot children, we have crowned a new successor. "
lupulan_events.1009.a: "Glorious will our reign be!"
lupulan_events.1009.b: "May their reign be better than the last"
lupulan_events.1010.t: "The Cycle Turns"
lupulan_events.1010.d.1: "As our troops march in victory formation past cheering throngs, there is a sense of change in the air. All have known for years that the Sri Baginda was old and weak, but it is only we who had the courage to do something about it. We shall invite all the Lupulan to our grand capital, and there we shall inform them all that there is a new Sri Baginda."
lupulan_events.1010.d.2: "The clash of battle has gone silent, and counted among the dead is the reign of the old Sri Baginda. For years their weakness has been a source of quiet discussion, but it is only now that their reign has been challenged. The armies of the Sri Baginda have been defeated in battle, and so a new Sri Baginda rises."
lupulan_events.1010.a: "Glorious will our reign be!"
lupulan_events.1010.b: "May their reign be better than the last"
lupulan_events.1011.d: "[sri_baginda_attacker_2.GetName] has declared war on [sri_baginda_help_2.GetName]. They have sent an envoy to our palace to remind us of our obligation as Sri Baginda to defend them against outside invaders, and have requested that we deploy our troops to the line of battle as soon as possible."
