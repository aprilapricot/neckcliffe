It follows the vitality of Halann, flowing like water; tributaries and rivulets empty into rivers and lakes. From this torrent we draw potential, and through that potential enact the will of the world. Yet remain wary of the conjoining of streams, as it is in their nature that one must be subsumed by the other.”\n-Master Ranxuan Qiu of the Transmutative Path\nAs spoken by the old master, it is in the nature of neighboring Chi Wellsprings to merge with one another. Through this union the flow of Chi mirrors the goal of mortals who follow the Transmutative Path — to become one with the cycle, accepting the assimilation of one will into the whole. Thus we do not weep for their passing, but accept that fundamental truth, and in turn are left with what residual Chi remains.""
