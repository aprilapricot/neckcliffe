 khadisrapur.0.t:0 "The Lone Hero"
 khadisrapur.0.desc:0 "This mission tree was made WITHOUT the Sir Revolt in mind. That being said, how would you like to proceed?"
 khadisrapur.0.a:0 "I would like the revolt to play out as normal, RNG and all."
 khadisrapur.0.b:0 "I would like The Command to take the strongest revolt!"
 khadisrapur.1.t:0 "The Return of Himmat the Hero"
 khadisrapur.1.d:0 "During the apex of the hobgoblin invasion in 1434, a number of nobles revolted against the ruling Jamma II Pirvand, rising in support of crown prince Balkevir Pirvand. The younger son of Jamma II, Balke became crown prince when his older brother, Himmat, relinquished his claims to the throne and chose the life of an adventurer. The young Balke was concerned by his aging father's reluctance to aid the faltering kingdom of Raghajandi, whose king was his wife's father. But Balke did not have the support of the army, which remained fiercely loyal to Jamma, and so he, his wife, and their supporters were defeated and sentenced to exile. In this way did Jamma II lose both of his sons.\n\nThat was a decade ago, and Khadisrapur has endured much in these ten long years. Now, though, the elder scion of the royal family has returned. The long-lost Himmat Pirvand has made his way to his father's court and now kneels before his father's throne to offer his services to his ailing fatherland. He is not alone; accompanying Himmat are the many mercenaries and adventurers he befriended in his travels. The man has changed - gone is the flamboyant firestarter, eager to prove himself. Instead, Himmat is now an experienced veteran and a hero of the people. He comes with radical ideas to modernize the military and has only one condition for his aid - that his younger brother be allowed to return to fight by his side."
