 flavor_beiklings.1.t:0 "The Avarice of Chinhu"
 flavor_beiklings.1.d:0 "Nothing blinds the soul quite like the glitter of gold.\n\nNestled in the Demon Hills, the Shirgrii of Kabiurgarko - called ’Chinhu’ by the local Beiklings - sits astride a veritable mountain of gold. The mines there are old, vast and seemingly endless, and it follows that the local government desires to keep this wealth to themselves. This so-called Council of Hungering Ones, has a well-earned reputation for covetousness, and they have ever been reluctant subjects at best.\n\nTherefore it comes as no surprise that tribute has gradually slowed to a trickle. We naturally assumed that the Council is hoarding the wealth, but they in turn claim that the Harimari of Hubao have been collecting taxes - that is to say, raided - across the border. The council posits that for one, they have neither the desire nor the obligation to pay taxes twice. If the government wishes to receive their taxes, they must ask Hubao. Secondly, as these raids seem to continue with no end in sight, the wealth of Chinhu is required to fend off the grasping Harimari. In truth, they posit, it is a travesty that we are not paying them for this service to the realm.\n\nIt is true that there is little love lost between the Beiklings of Chinhu and the Harimari of Hubao. Are raids across the border probable? Certainly. Provable? Perhaps.\n\nDoes this all sound like an excuse for Chinhu to keep their wealth to themselves? Absolutely."
 flavor_beiklings.1.a:0 "An excuse it may be, but we can loosen the reins for now, while we deal with Hubao."
 flavor_beiklings.1.b:0 "Everyone pays tax, except for the rich. I mean, especially the rich. Send in the taxmen!"
 flavor_beiklings.1.c:0 "A mountain of gold, you say? ...Maybe I will move to Chinhu."

 flavor_beiklings.2.t:0 "Xiongxiap Rises!"
 flavor_beiklings.2.d:0 "Our war against the Jiangshi of Jinqiu has taken an ironic turn.\n\nAs our troops crossed the border into the rugged borderlands of the Black Jade Citadel, we encountered envoys from the league of Xiongxiap. It appears that they, likely anticipating the imminent change in overlords, are willing to support our invasion against the Eternal Council, in return for certain concessions and guarantees under the new regime.\n\nWhile their lack of loyalty is deplorable, their duplicity stands to benefit us. They are weak, and while they are ready to offer us access to either their coffers or their warriors, their envoy insists that they cannot part with both. But, the envoy is quick to point out, there may be an alternative.\n\nWeizhen Suzhen, the current leader of the league, is the mind behind this plot, and he stands to lose everything if it fails. We could, rather than merely accept his modest offers of support, put our full support behind him instead. Doing so would no doubt galvanize the league into a far more formidable force, and would make Suzhen dependent on us in perpetuity."
 flavor_beiklings.2.a:0 "Local auxiliaries familiar with these lands will benefit our forces greatly."
 flavor_beiklings.2.b:0 "Is this all the wealth Xiongxiap can offer? Well, we will take it regardless."
 flavor_beiklings.2.c:0 "I detest traitors. We refuse to be linked to them."
 flavor_beiklings.2.e:0 "Send word and troops to Weizhen Suzhen. $COUNTRY$ stands with Xiongxiap!"

 flavor_beiklings.3.t:0 "Jianlin Politely Revolts!"
 flavor_beiklings.3.d:0 "Our recent investments into the city of Yangcheng has resulted in a surprising backlash. One of our own cities apparently resents our investment abroad, claiming that this money could be better spent domestically. Nowhere is this sentiment stronger than in the Beikling city of Jianlin, where the Stratocratic Order of Closed Mouths, their local government, have penned an immaculately polite, yet scathing letter, condemning what they call ’reckless expansionism and unneeded consolidation of the League of Yanszin, at the expense of the people of Yanshen in general, and the honourable citizenry of Jianlin in particular’.\n\nAs a result, the city of Jianlin now requests subsidies from the league, to encourage local development, and to prove - in their own words - ’that the leadership of the League remains committed to the rights and freedoms of the great cities on which it rests’. Doing so would no doubt be expensive, but the Jianlin leadership is to our knowledge honourable. If we support them, they will no doubt develop their domain, to the benefit of the league as a whole. And of course, should we refuse, it will no doubt lead to increased friction within the league.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
 flavor_beiklings.3.a:0 "The League must prosper in unity. Let us invest in Jianlin."
 flavor_beiklings.3.b:0 "This letter is an insult. We have already given Jianlin more than they deserve."
 flavor_beiklings.3.c:0 "If they so fear being marginalized, they have another thing coming. Pack up everything! We are moving the court to Jianlin!"

 flavor_beiklings.4.t:0 "The Mask of Many Faces"
 flavor_beiklings.4.d:0 "Might, the power to rule.\nWealth, a sign of prosperity.\nControl, of oneself and of others.\nAnd Right, to sit on the throne and wear the mask.\n\nThe streets of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ are alight with lamps. Hundreds of thousands of Beiklings have donned masks, and throughout the city, festivities, parades and prayers are being held, as the people celebrate the revival of Great Luzhong.\n\nBut inside the palace, the court is silent. Heavy drapes cover the windows, and only the violet lanterns of the royal guard prevent the room from being shrouded in total darkness. Every envoy, every magistrate, and every noble rests on their knees, their heads bowed towards the throne, where $MONARCH$ stands waiting in the gloom. One by one, the masks are brought in, carried on pillows of Jinqiu black silk. As the first mask bearer reaches the throne, $MONARCH$ seizes the mask reverently, as the mask bearer kowtows at their feet. The second mask bearer does the same, as $MONARCH$ joins one mask to the other. There is no sound, no click, no tinkering required. Two simply become one, and the silence filling the room grows louder. A third joins its siblings, and the court hears the blood flowing in their veins, the silence so absolute that their heartbeats grow loud as drums. As ever so slowly, their hearts begin to beat in unison.\n\nAs the fourth and final mask is joined, the court breathes as one, a noise like a storm in the deafening quiet. For a moment, there is absolute silence. Hearts still. Breathing stalls. The court seems frozen in time. $MONARCH$ holds the Mask of Many Faces before him. There is a moment of clarity. In the silence, he can hear the mask speak, words so many that they coalesce into an incessant buzz. Words that will become his own."
