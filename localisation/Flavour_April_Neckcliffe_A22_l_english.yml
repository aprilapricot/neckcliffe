 neckcliffe_immediate.1.t:0 "Lost Honor"
 neckcliffe_immediate.1.d:0 "We have been faithful servants of Dameria and the Empire for ages, reliable and steadfast. Thus, when the Lilac Wars came, we backed our liege and followed him into battle against his foes. Even as the tide of war slowly turned against us, we stayed true to our loyalties. During the Betrayal of Wesdam, we dutifully transported as many as we could to the Damesear and though we saved only a fraction of the army, without our help the war might have ended right there. Lorentish revenge was swift however, sailing their ships into the Dameshead and, with the help of several powerful magi, sunk the glorious imperial navy, and our ruler, to the bottom of the seas. Suddenly, we were alone. Cut off from all of our allies and surrounded by many who would happily end us. With heavy hearts we did the only reasonable thing to save our lands and people; joined Lorent and the Rose Party. Ever since, our honor has been sullied. We are in a strenuous relationship where one side considers us not trustworthy and the other considers us traitors. Furthermore, Throatport, our largest city and ever the source of our headache, completely succumbed to crime and is barely under our control."
 neckcliffe_immediate.1.a:0 "Truly a tragedy."

 neckcliffe.1.t:0 "Approached by the Druids"
 neckcliffe.1.d:0 "As our troops advanced into the Ancient Forests of Woodwell, our lumberers wasted no time following behind hoping to secure whatever timber they could sink their axes into. Peculiarly, these lumberers oftentimes returned emptyhanded - or sometimes they had not returned at all. Those who had made their way back described the forests as ever-changing and ever-growing, a labrinyth of trees and vines that responded to their presence. The generals of our army; however, had reported no such things. \"Was the forest aware of their intent to strip it, protecting itself from the timberman's axe?" [Root.Monarch.GetName] wondered.\n\nHaving given the decree to secure a source of lumber to restore the navy, [Root.Monarch.GetName] descended upon the forests [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to observe the spectacle first-hand. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] entered the forests, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was engulfed in a flurry of flora which had cut [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] off entirely from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] escorts. Then, several entities emerged from the dark, adorned with leaves and flowers of all shapes and sizes - [Root.Monarch.GetName] recognized them - Druids. But, this could be an opportunity. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] was thinking to [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] one of the Druids spoke, \"We know your reason for being here, [Root.Monarch.GetName]. We care not for what banner claims the forest, but we cannot allow it to be harmed. This place protects us, and in turn, we protect it. You must leave and never again send your men." That would not do. This forest was abundant with the lumber required to restore the navy to its previous prestige, and one day reclaim the rights to the Imperial Navy. "I understand your hesitance, but I believe I can make you an offer that would benefit us both." [Root.Monarch.GetName] calmly replied. \"I can guarantee the autonomy of this forest to the Druids, and in turn you would allow my lumberers within. You may oversee any operations within your borders and direct them as you would like. We would not bring harm to your home."\n\nThe Druids appeared to be taken aback by this offer, but did not deny outright. They then disappeared into the growth as quickly as they had appeared, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] was freed from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] captivity, appearing once more with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entourage. The silence was deafening amongst the party, as they had just previously seen their Monarch disappear before their eyes. The escorts hurriedly pushed the Monarch to leave this place at once, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] was oddly at ease. As the party journied back towards the Capitol, [Root.Monarch.GetName] eagerly awaited the response of the Druids."
 neckcliffe.1.a:0 "What an exciting turn of events!"

 neckcliffe.2.t:0 "The Druid's Response"
 neckcliffe.2.d:0 "A timberman covered in mud had arrived at the Royal Court urging to see [Root.Monarch.GetName], claiming they had a letter to deliver from the forests. The gaurds had barred them from entry - to many this timberman appeared derranged and insane. Their appearance and demeanor hardly fit the setting. Though when [Root.Monarch.GetName] had caught wind of this new arrival, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] demanded they be let through at once.\n\nArriving before the Monarch, the timberman explained what had happened. A tangle of vines had knocked them to the ground when they had tried to enter the Ancient Forests once more, and a humanoid had appeared before them grasping the message. It had told them to deliver the letter to the Monarch without delay. [Root.Monarch.GetName] opened the letter, pleasantly much cleaner than the lumberer before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], which outlined the terms of cooperation between the druids in theforests and those of [Root.GetName]. The terms were acceptable, and a formal response was readied with haste."
